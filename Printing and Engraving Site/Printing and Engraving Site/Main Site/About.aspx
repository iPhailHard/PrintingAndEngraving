        <h3>About Our Company</h3>
    <p>We are a family run business that has been operating since.Today we employ a large group of professionals 
        and offer a number of quality products for your team or business ranging from quality screen printed 
        team uniforms and trophies for your athletes, to embroidered company work shirts.</p>

<p>In 1974, our father started this business with just a single printing screen in his garage in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. 
    He’d just left college and had was discovering his area of education might not be best suited for him. 
    While working at a downtown burger joint, he and our mother invested in a screen printer to make a little extra 
    money on the side for vacations and luxuries. In those days, he had no machines and managed to offer a quality product 
    made with a full necessary hand tools and his hands themselves. In just a few years, word of the product fell on more 
    and more ears and my father had no choice to begin investing in machinery to help run his already profitable business. 
    A few years after that, our mother would quit her job to assist in running the operation. By 1983, they would open their 
    first engraving and embroidery storefront in downtown Lake Geneva. By 1998 we moved to our large warehouse accommodations 
    that you know today. We’ve been busy every since.
